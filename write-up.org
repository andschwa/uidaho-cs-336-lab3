** Turn off PHP Magic Quote Countermeasure

Prior to version 5.3.0, PHP enabled a countermeasure to SQL injection
attacks called "Magic Quote". To disable this, we simply edit the PHP
configuration file =/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini= and change the line
=magic quotes gpc = On= to =magic quotes gpc = Off=; finally, to make
these changes live, we execute the command =sudo service apache2
restart=. (Du 3)
